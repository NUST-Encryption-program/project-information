#依赖注入
=================================================================

***


依赖注入不是目的，它是一系列工具和手段，最终的目的是帮助我们开发出松散耦合(loose coupled)、可维护、可测试的代码和程序。这条原则的做法是大家熟知的面向接口，或者说是面向抽象编程。

什么是依赖注入？

Stack Overflow的经典解释：“When you go and get things out of the refrigerator for yourself, you can cause problems. You might leave the door open, you might get something Mommy or Daddy doesn’t want you to have. You might even be looking for something we don’t even have or which has expired.

What you should be doing is stating a need, “I need something to drink with lunch,” and then we will make sure you have something when you sit down to eat.”
